# Get started quickly
1. VlessSub (VLESS subscriber code) can be deployed by yourself according to the deployment method of vless subscriber, and add the preferred ip api
https://subscriber domain name/sub?host=xxxx&uuid=xxxx&proxyip=true or false (true means enabling the proxyIP setting in the subscriber).
2. _worker.js (configuration for VLESS node) deployment only requires changing uuid and token
https://[your domain name]/[your token] is the adaptive subscription link page for obtaining the subscription link.
